ROLauncher
==========

What is that?
--------------
ROLaucher is nothing more than a simple batch script used to launch both RCX and Ragnarok Online at the same time.
If you are lazy (like me) or want to clean up your shortcuts, it's a must.

Also, the binary version can be added to your Steam as a Non-Steam Game for a achiev a better and more organized games library.
You can get that here: *to add

How that works?
---------------
Launcher.ini holds just your RCX and RO paths, and Launcher.bat utilizes that information to launch both applications.
